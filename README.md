# MultiCheXNet (PyTorch)

A clean PyTorch reimplementation of **MultiCheXNet** — a single DenseNet-121 encoder shared by three task heads that run in **one forward pass**:

| Head | Task | Trained on | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Classifier** | 3-class classification | derived from the two datasets below | normal / pneumothorax / pneumonia |
| **Detector** | object detection (Tiny-YOLOv2 style) | RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge | bounding boxes around pneumonia opacities |
| **Segmenter** | binary segmentation (Tiramisu-style decoder w/ skip connections) | SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation | pixel mask of the pneumothorax region |

This is a from-scratch PyTorch port of the original Keras/TensorFlow [MultiCheXNet](https://github.com/coursat-ai/MultiCheXNet) project, based on the [MultiNet architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07695.pdf) applied to chest X-rays. The model architecture, loss functions, and training scheme (alternating-batch joint training) are faithfully translated, but the code is reorganized into a small, readable package instead of the original scattered scripts.

> **Scope note:** the original repo also contained an experimental "report generation" head (an LSTM captioning model on the Indiana University chest X-ray dataset). That's a separate NLP subsystem and is intentionally left out here to keep the project focused and easy to run end-to-end on a single Colab/Kaggle T4 GPU. Open an issue if you'd like it added back in.

## Architecture

All three heads share the same DenseNet-121 encoder, so a single forward pass produces all three outputs. Beyond the speed-up of not running three separate models, joint training (per the original paper) also acts as a form of multi-task regularization that improves each individual task.

## Quick start (Colab / Kaggle, T4 GPU)

1. Zip the `src/`, `app/`, `requirements.txt` (this whole folder) and upload it to your Colab session — or push it to a GitHub repo and `git clone` it in the first cell of `00_Setup_and_Data.ipynb`.
2. Open the notebooks in order:
   - **`00_Setup_and_Data.ipynb`** — installs dependencies and downloads the SIIM-ACR and RSNA datasets via the Kaggle API (you'll need to upload your `kaggle.json`, or use Kaggle's built-in "Add Data" if running there).
   - **`01_Train_Segmenter.ipynb`**, **`02_Train_Detector.ipynb`**, **`03_Train_Classifier.ipynb`** — train each head standalone first (faster to debug, and gives good warm-start weights).
   - **`04_Train_MTL_Joint.ipynb`** — loads the 3 checkpoints above into one shared-encoder model and fine-tunes all heads jointly.
   - **`05_Inference_and_Deployment.ipynb`** — run inference on a sample image, export a portable TorchScript file, and launch a Gradio demo.
3. Batch sizes in the notebooks (16 for single-head, 8 for joint MTL) are sized for a 16GB T4 at 256x256 resolution — lower them if you hit out-of-memory errors, raise them if you have more headroom (e.g. an A100).

### Running locally instead

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.models.mtl_model        # quick shape sanity check
python app/gradio_app.py --checkpoint /path/to/mtl_best.pt --share
```

## Datasets

Multiple datasets are used across the training pipeline:

| Dataset | Used for | Format |
|---|---|---|
| [SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/jesperdramsch/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation-data) | Segmentation head | DICOM images + CSV of run-length-encoded masks (`ImageId`, `EncodedPixels`) |
| [RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge) | Detection head | DICOM images + CSV of bounding boxes (`patientId`, `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, `Target`) |
| [NIH Chest X-rays](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) | Additional classification context (per original MultiCheXNet) | Images + multi-label CSV |

Both the SIIM-ACR and RSNA datasets are downloaded automatically by `00_Setup_and_Data.ipynb` via the Kaggle API. Classification labels are derived automatically: an image is `pneumothorax` if it has a positive SIIM-ACR mask, `pneumonia` if it has a positive RSNA box, and `normal` otherwise.

## Key implementation notes (vs. the original Keras code)

- **Encoder:** `torchvision.models.densenet121` (ImageNet-pretrained), split into stages so we can tap skip connections for the segmentation decoder, instead of Keras layer-index slicing.
- **Detection loss:** same Tiny-YOLOv2 formulation (5 anchors, objectness + no-object + coordinate + class terms), rewritten in plain PyTorch tensor ops instead of `tf.function` graph code.
- **Segmentation loss:** same Dice loss.
- **"Ignore" samples:** the original code filled un-available targets with `-1` so a single loss function could handle "this sample has no ground truth for this head" inside a mixed batch. We keep exactly that convention (`config.IGNORE_VALUE`), so `YoloLoss` / `DiceLoss` both zero out the loss for any sample whose target is entirely `-1`.
- **Joint training loop:** the original `MTL_generator` cycled through segmentation → detection → (report) batches. We reproduce the two-source alternation with `MTLJointLoader`, a small round-robin wrapper around two ordinary PyTorch `DataLoader`s — no custom `Sequence` class needed.
- **Weight transplanting between single-task and joint models:** the original code manually matched Keras layer indices. In PyTorch, every head is just a named submodule, so we simply do `joint_model.load_state_dict(single_task_state_dict, strict=False)` and let PyTorch match by name (see notebook `04`).

## Extending this project

- Swap `torchvision.models.densenet121` for another backbone (e.g. `efficientnet_b0`) — you'll need to update the skip-connection channel counts in `encoder.py` and `heads.py::SegmenterHead`.
- Add more detection classes: bump `config.N_DET_CLASSES` and pass `class_ids` into `boxes_to_yolo_target`.
- Add the report-generation head back in: it would be a 4th head (an LSTM/transformer decoder conditioned on the encoder features) with its own dataset (Indiana University chest X-ray reports) and loss (cross-entropy over vocabulary) — open an issue if you'd like help building this as a follow-up.
